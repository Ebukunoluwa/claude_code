## Red Flag Probes

One observation per probe. Where a single upstream flag splits into multiple probes (e.g. `postpartum_haemorrhage` → `_volume` / `_clots` / `_haemodynamic`), all children are listed under the same header with their `parent_flag_code`.

### `cardiac_arrest_signs` (1 probe)

**`cardiac_arrest_witnessed_collapse`** → pathway_specific / 999
> Has anyone around you — family, carer, or neighbour — found you collapsed and unresponsive in the last few days, or had to call for emergency help for you?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 / CG172

### `chest_pain_at_rest` (1 probe)

**`chest_pain_at_rest`** → chest_pain / 999
> Have you had chest pain that came on at rest — while sitting still, lying down, or not doing anything — and felt tight, crushing, or central rather than a sharp or sternal ache?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 §1.3 / CG172

### `chest_pain_on_minimal_exertion` (1 probe)

**`chest_pain_on_minimal_exertion`** → chest_pain / same_day
> Have you had chest pain come on with a small effort today — like standing up from a chair, walking across a room, or climbing one flight of stairs — and felt tight or crushing rather than a sternal ache?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 §1.3 / CG172

### `pe_symptoms` (split into 2 probes)

**`pe_symptoms_breathing`** → acute_shortness_of_breath / 999
> Have you had any sudden breathlessness today that made you stop what you were doing?

_NICE basis:_ NG89 §1.3 / NG158

**`pe_symptoms_chest_pain`** → chest_pain / 999
> Any sharp chest pain on one side — especially when you breathe in deeply?

_NICE basis:_ NG89 §1.3 / NG158

### `sternal_wound_breakdown` (split into 3 probes)

**`sternal_wound_clicking`** → pathway_specific / same_day
> Can you feel any clicking, grinding, or moving feeling in your breast bone when you cough, take a deep breath, or turn in bed?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 §1.5

**`sternal_wound_discharge`** → pathway_specific / same_day
> Is there any pus or bloody fluid coming from the chest scar?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 §1.5 / QS48

**`sternal_wound_separation`** → pathway_specific / 999
> Has the scar on your chest opened up — with a visible gap between the edges, or can you see the breast bone underneath?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 §1.5

### `sustained_palpitations` (split into 2 probes)

**`palpitations_sustained`** → pathway_specific / same_day
> Have you had any sudden fluttering or racing heartbeat — palpitations — that lasted more than about half an hour, or that kept coming back today?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 / CG172

**`palpitations_with_red_flag_symptoms`** → pathway_specific / 999
> When the fluttering or racing happened, did you also get chest pain, breathlessness, or feel like you might pass out?

_NICE basis:_ NG185 / CG172


## Reviewer checklist

### Trajectory values
- [ ] Expected/upper-bound values clinically reasonable for each day + domain?
- [ ] Day coverage matches the playbook `call_days`?
- [ ] Any values that feel too conservative or too permissive?

### Required questions
- [ ] Every question clinically necessary?
- [ ] Any critical items missing for this pathway?
- [ ] Day-band placement appropriate?
- [ ] Wording acceptable for a voice agent to read aloud?
- [ ] Multi-part phrasings decompose into independently scoreable parts?

### Red flag probes
- [ ] Patient-facing wording free of clinical jargon?
- [ ] Escalation tier (999 / same_day / urgent_gp / next_call) appropriate?
- [ ] Every probe asks ONE clinical question (no compound 'or' phrasing)?
- [ ] Split parent codes cover the clinical entity without gaps?
- [ ] Non-judgmental framing for mental-health items?

### CLINICAL_REVIEW_NEEDED flags

- [ ] CLINICAL_REVIEW_NEEDED: upstream pathway_map.red_flags for K40 lists only "chest_pain_at_rest". Added "chest_pain_on_minimal_exertion" as a separate parent for the SAME_DAY probe. Reviewer to confirm whether this new parent code should propagate to the upstream map + dashboards, or whether the two probes should share a single parent "chest_pain" with the tier delta resolved at Phase 4.
- [ ] CLINICAL_REVIEW_NEEDED: compound rule for Phase 4 call-status layer — chest_pain_on_minimal_exertion + any breathlessness or syncope probe firing together suggests crescendo angina / re- infarction and should escalate to EMERGENCY_999.
- [ ] CLINICAL_REVIEW_NEEDED: K40_CABG inherits K40's new parent code "chest_pain_on_minimal_exertion". Same upstream-map propagation decision applies — reviewer to confirm once for the whole cardiac cluster rather than per-pathway.
- [ ] CLINICAL_REVIEW_NEEDED: cardiac_arrest_witnessed_collapse uses coverage-check framing because the patient cannot self-report loss of consciousness with no return of pulse. Reviewer to confirm: should this also gate behind an explicit "is anyone with you?" intake flag at the voice-agent layer rather than rely on whoever answers the call?
